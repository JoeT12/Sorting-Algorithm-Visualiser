# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

A sorting algorithm visualiser created with the React framework. Includes: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort and heap sort.

# How to use

To visualise a sort, start by pressing on the sort you wish to visualise on the navbar. Then, choose the animation speed using the slider at the top (left = low speed, right = high speed). Then navigate beneath the bars to "sort" button, and press it to begin the animation.

# NOTE

Please be aware that upon activating a sorting algorithm, all buttons will be disabled (until the sort is complete) in order to prevent any interuption to the animation. If you wish to stop an animation, you may do so by refreshing the page.
